# Hi! 👋 I'm Valentino Montecinos.

I enjoy coding 💻 as much as coffee ☕.


## 🤔 What do I do?

I am a Full Stack Web Developer, although I like more designing and developing the Front end side. Started with GameDev in 2022 but ended up liking more creating websites. Currently looking to learn new skills.


## 🛠 Skills
Javascript, React, Redux, Tailwind, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, bun.
